					My name is Nicolae, lives in Södertälje and I'm 48 years old. I had settled before to working in the IT industry but I could not do this because of various reasons.
          In 2010 I have moved in Sweden and have started a new life.
          Now I have finished education as a Javascript frontend-developer and now I take this step in my life with a major provocation.
